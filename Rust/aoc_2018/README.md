# Advent of code with Rust

I came across [aoc-runner](https://crates.io/crates/aoc-runner), a nice crate to easily run the aoc challenges so I will give it a try.

## Run

If you have rust and cargo-aoc installed (`cargo install cargo-aoc`), you can run it for the current day with `cargo aoc`

## Test

You can run all tests with `cargo test`, run `cargo test dayx` to only run that day
